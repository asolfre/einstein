#summary Installing a Newton ROM on an iOS device

= Introduction =

Einstein Emulator requires an MP2x00 US ROM image. 
The ROM file must be named 717006.rom and copied to 
your device using the iTunes File Sharing feature.

= Installing the ROM =

Use one of the methods described here to acquire a US Newton MP2x00 ROM:

http://code.google.com/p/einstein/downloads/detail?name=UserManual.pdf&can=2&q=#makechanges

Rename the ROM to _717006.rom_ and upload it to your iOS device using _iTunes_.

  * launch iTunes
  * connect your iPhone or iPad device
  * click on your device in the _Devices_ list
  * select the _Apps_ tab
  * under _File Sharing_, click on the _iEinstein_ icon
  * drag the ROM file into the _iEinstein Documents_ list
  * synchronize your device and relaunch iEinstein

iEinstein also accepts the Lantern DDK image files. They must be named "717006.aif" and "717006.rex".

= Installing Packages =

You can download hundreds of packages from http://www.unna.org/

  * connect your iPhone to your computer and run iTunes
  * launch iEinstein on your device and let it boot up all the way
  * open File Sharing in iTunes and drag the packages into the file list
    * the iPhone will briefly show "Sync in Progress"
    * when back in iEinstein, Newton OS will install the package

The package in the file sharing list is no longer needed, you can delete it now or keep it around. To reinstall a package, drop it into the file list again.

Use the Newton OS  Drawer to uninstall packages from the Newton by tapping and holding, then choosing _delete_ from the file menu.
