#summary An overview of Einstein's architecture.

(...work in progress...)

== ROM Image ==

In order to run, Einstein requires a ROM dump from a real Newton.  We cannot provide you this ROM file, but you can generate one from your own hardware if you own a Newton.  The ROM file is expected to be exactly 8 megabytes in size.  Most development is being done with the version 717006 ROM.

== Einstein.rex ==

Einstein.rex is a Newton ROM extension, built with the Newton developer tools in much the same way as you would build a ROM patch for an actual Newton.  It provides glue code to re-route hardware dependencies to the virtual emulator hardware.  Einstein loads the REx and applies it to the vanilla ROM when the emulator first starts up.
