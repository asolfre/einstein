NewtonOS is now running on any Android 2.2 device and up. I recommend a CPU with at least 1GHz. More is better. This release is still in Beta, but I am very positive that this will be the first version of Einstein running on a PDA that has the potential to replace the MessagePad.

On the low end, this will likely run fine on a hacked $200 Nook Color, but as a highlight, I will hopefully be able to support the HTC Flyer and Samsung Galaxy Note which come with a great stylus.

For the brave among you Android device owners, you will find an early test version in the Downloads section.

Copy the file 717006.rom and Einstein.rex to /Download/Einstein on your Android device. Then install and launch the Android Package. The first launch will take quite a while, but after the Flash RAM is set up, further launches will be quicker.

PS: NOT YET WORKING: I am currently (Dec 3rd, 2011) trying to get network support going. Here is what you need to do:

Make sure that your version of Einstein has a menu item (Android menu button) that sais "Network". Don't press it now, just make sure it is there.

Now install the following packages on-by-on by dropping them into "/Download/Einstein" and selecting "Install" from the Android menu:

  * inetenbl.pkg (www.unna.org)
  * newtdev.pkg (www.unna.org)to be continued)
  * enetsup.pkg (www.unna.org)
  * inetstup.pkg (www.unna.org)
  * NE2K.pkg (part of Einstein)

(to be continued)
