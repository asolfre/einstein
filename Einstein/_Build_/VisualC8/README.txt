VisualC 8 does not recognize C++ files ending in .cp by default. To allow
compilation of this Solution, you will have to teach VisualC the .cp
file extension first, then reload the solution.

Click on the menu "Tools", the choose "Options"
Open "Projects and Solution", click on "VisualC++ Project Settings"
In "C/C++ File Extensions", append  ;*.cp

Happy coding,
