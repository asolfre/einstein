This file contains a hierarchical todo list for Albert OS

- (done) initial Albert interface in Einstein
- (done) sample implementation of a Newton OS function, explaining
         the concept of Albert and the stb based interface
- (done) interface to read emulator RAM from within Albert, ignoring 
         MMU access exceptions
- (done) sample implementation of a function, calling another function
         within Albert (self-contained nature of Albert)
- (done) sample implementation of class member access
- (done) implement a macro that allows a native code to call 
         an emulated function
- (done) implemet a function that decides if Albert OS or the 
         Emulator must be called
- (done) sample implementation of calls via function pointer
- (done) implement a macro that handles function hooks efficiently
- implement DataAbort() 
   - (active) implement functions that are called by DataAbort()
- test implementation for stand-alone AlbertOS
- sample implementation of partial function replacement
- sample implementation of class constructor and destructor
- interface to emulator RAM with access violation handling
- evaluate hit count for all functions in Newton OS
- implement either class-by-class or as indicated by hit-count
- replace neccesity for an MMU
