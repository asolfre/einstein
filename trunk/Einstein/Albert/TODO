This file contains a hierarchical todo list for Albert OS

- (done) initial Albert interface in Einstein
- (done) sample implementation of a Newton OS function, explaining
         the concept of Albert and the stb based interface
- interface to read emulator RAM from within Albert
- (done) sample implementation of a function, calling another function
         within Albert (self-contained nature of Albert)
- sample implementation of a class and class member access
- sample implementation of partial function replacement
- extract ROM call tree using DyneE5
- implement DataAbort() 
   - implement functions that are called by DataAbort()
- evaluate hit count for all functions in Newton OS
